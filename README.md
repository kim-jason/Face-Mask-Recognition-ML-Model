# Face-Mask-Recognition-ML-Model
ML model that recognizes if an individual is wearing a face mask in a photo.

Created a ML model that recognizes with 97.6% accuracy if an individual is wearing a face mask in a photo. Optimized the base ResNet model (https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionresnetv2/) through data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning. Awarded 2nd place in semester competition for CIS521 Artificial Intelligence (graduate level).
